	<p>
		This Java library provides the implementation of <a href="http://mrstampy.github.io/ESP/">ESP</a> library classes to acquire the
		processed data and raw EEG signal from NeuroSky ThinkGear devices. 
		ESP-ThinkGear was compiled for Java version 1.6 compatibility. The core classes have been designed with speed and concurrency
		in mind using high performance Java libraries:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor">Disruptor</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://javolution.org/">Javolution</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://mina.apache.org/">Apache MINA</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/">RxJava</a></li>
	</ul>
			
	<h2>Design Goals</h2>
	
	<p>
		<a href="http://mrstampy.github.io/ESP/">ESP</a> is designed to provide Java programs access to EEG device signals
		and provide the ability to process the signals for the purposes of the program.
		The ESP library itself is not an implementation, however there are several implementations
		for specific EEG devices:
		
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://mrstampy.github.io/ESP-Nia/">ESP-Nia</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://mrstampy.github.io/ESP-ThinkGear/">ESP-ThinkGear</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://mrstampy.github.io/ESP-OpenBCI/">ESP-OpenBCI (experimental)</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://mrstampy.github.io/ESPLab/">ESPLab (JavaFX 8.0 GUI for the ESP Lab interface)</a></li>
		</ul>
		
		ESP provides a common structure for device specific implementations.  This allows programs
		using the ESP libraries to cater for multiple devices from a single codebase.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The core classes have been designed with speed and concurrency in mind using high performance Java libraries:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor">Disruptor</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://javolution.org/">Javolution</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://mina.apache.org/">Apache MINA</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/">RxJava</a></li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<h2>Primary Design Specifics</h2>
	
	<h3><a href="com/github/mrstampy/esp/neurosky/MultiConnectionThinkGearSocket.html">The MultiConnectSocket Interface</a></h3>
	
	<p>
		This interface defines the methods that must be implemented for a class
		which provides access to EEG hardware.  
		An <a href="com/github/mrstampy/esp/multiconnectionsocket/AbstractMultiConnectionSocket.html">abstract superclass</a>
		exists for ease of implementation.
	</p>
	
	<h3><a href="com/github/mrstampy/esp/neurosky/ThinkGearConnection.html">The RawEspConnection Interface</a></h3>
	
	<p>
		RawEspConnection extends the MultiConnectSocket interface.
		Implementations are intended to encapsulate and control a MultiConnectSocket instance through the implementation
		of the common methods, as well as provide the current seconds' worth of samples on demand for direct use or further
		processing.  Signal processing methods exist to provide ease of processing the signal.  
		An <a href="com/github/mrstampy/esp/dsp/lab/AbstractRawEspConnection.html">abstract superclass</a>
		exists for ease of implementation.
	</p>
	
	<h3><a href="com/github/mrstampy/esp/dsp/lab/Lab.html">The Lab Interface</a></h3>
	
	<p>
		While the ESP library provides DSP processing classes, how the signal is processed is left to 
		programs using the library.  Lab implementations provide the ability to obtain the current seconds' worth of samples
		from the encapsulated RawEspConnection, process the signal and notify the program when a sample is ready for use.
		
		A <a href="com/github/mrstampy/esp/dsp/lab/DefaultLab.html">default implementation</a>
		exists and an <a href="com/github/mrstampy/esp/dsp/lab/AbstractLab.html">abstract superclass</a> provides ease
		of custom lab implementation. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>Usage</h2>
	
	<h3>Direct MultiConnectSocket Usage</h3>
	
	<p>
		This is the lowest level use case.  Programs using ESP library implementations in this manner
		will receive device-specific signals as they occur.  Each implementation of the ESP library's MultiConnectSocket
		has a device-specific listener mechanism to obtain the signal.  Pseudo code for usage appears as so:
		
		<code>
			<pre>
			MultiConnectionThinkGearSocket socket = new MultiConnectionThinkGearSocket();
			
			// optional, common to all MultiConnectSocket implementations:
			// add a listener to receive connect/disconnect events
			socket.addConnectionEventListener(new <a href="com/github/mrstampy/esp/multiconnectionsocket/ConnectionEventListener.html">ConnectionEventListener()</a> {
				public void connectionEventPerformed(ConnectionEvent e) {
					doSomethingWith(e);
				}
			});
			
			socket.addListener(new <a href="com/github/mrstampy/esp/neurosky/subscription/ThinkGearEventListener.html">ThinkGearEventListener()</a> {
				public void niaEventPerformed(ThinkGearEvent event) {
					doSomethingWith(e);
				}
			});
			
			socket.start();
			</pre>
		</code>
	</p>
	
	<h3>Direct MultiConnectSocket Usage - Remote Connection</h3>
	
	<p>
		This functionality is from where the MultiConnectSocket derives its name.  Device specific
		implementations provide the ability to open a socket on a configurable port.  Such sockets
		facilitate a subscribe and publish of device signals. This allows separate processes and machines
		to <a href="com/github/mrstampy/esp/neurosky/subscription/ThinkGearSocketConnector.html">receive the device signals</a> 
		for their own purposes - signal recording, secondary processing, display etc.
				
		<code>
			<pre>
			// on the host machine or process:
			// port is set via the system property 'socket.broadcaster.port', default '12345'
 			MultiConnectionThinkGearSocket socket = new MultiConnectionThinkGearSocket(true);
			
			// on the remote process/machine:
			// port is set via the system property 'socket.broadcaster.port', default '12345'
			ThinkGearSocketConnector connector = new ThinkGearSocketConnector("host machine name or IP address");
			
			connector.addListener(new <a href="com/github/mrstampy/esp/neurosky/subscription/ThinkGearEventListener.html">ThinkGearEventListener()</a> {
				public void niaEventPerformed(ThinkGearEvent event) {
					doSomethingWith(e);
				}
			});
			
			connector.connect();
			connector.subscribe(....);
			
			// and back on the host machine or process:
			socket.start();
			</pre>
		</code>
	</p>
	
	<h3>RawEspConnection Usage</h3>
	
	<p>
		RawEspConnection implementations aggregate the current second's worth of data, insulating the
		program from device specific listeners.  The samples are intended to be queried periodically
		in a separate scheduled task or thread.  The period of querying is left to the program and is independent
		of sample rate.
		
		<code>
			<pre>
			ThinkGearConnection connection = new ThinkGearConnection();
			
			// optional, common to all RawEspConnection implementations:
			// add a listener to receive connect/disconnect events
			connection.addConnectionEventListener(new <a href="com/github/mrstampy/esp/multiconnectionsocket/ConnectionEventListener.html">ConnectionEventListener()</a> {
				public void connectionEventPerformed(ConnectionEvent e) {
					doSomethingWith(e);
				}
			});
			
			connection.start();
			
			// in a separate scheduled periodic task..
			int channel = 1; // channel of interest 
			dealWithCurrentSecondOfSamples(connection.getCurrentFor(channel));
			</pre>
		</code>
	</p>
	
	<h3>Lab Usage</h3>
	
	<p>
		Lab implementations provide the ability to process the current seconds' worth of
		data from the RawEspConnection and notify any interested parties of its completion.
		Triggering of signal processing is intended to be executed periodically
		in a separate scheduled task or thread.  The period of triggering is left to the program and is independent
		of sample rate.
		<code>
			<pre>
			ThinkGearConnection connection = new ThinkGearConnection();
			
			// optional, common to all RawEspConnection implementations:
			// add a listener to receive connect/disconnect events
			connection.addConnectionEventListener(new <a href="com/github/mrstampy/esp/multiconnectionsocket/ConnectionEventListener.html">ConnectionEventListener()</a> {
				public void connectionEventPerformed(ConnectionEvent e) {
					doSomethingWith(e);
				}
			});
			
			Lab lab = connection.getDefaultLab();
			
			int numBands = 40; // first 40 bands
			lab.setNumBands(numBands); // must be set
			
			int channel = 1; // channel of interest for multichannels
			lab.setChannel(channel); // required if > 1 channel
			
			lab.addSignalProcessedListener(new SignalProcessedListener() {
				public void signalProcessed(double[] processed) {
					doSomethingWith(processed);
				}
			});
			
			// other lab values set as appropriate for processing the signal
			
			connection.start();
			
			// in a separate scheduled periodic task..
			lab.triggerProcessing();
			</pre>
		</code>

	<h2>Example classes</h2>
	
	<p>
		<a href="com/github/mrstampy/esp/neurosky/ThinkGearTester.html">ThinkGearTester</a><br></br>
	</p>
	
	<h2>Architecture</h2>
	
	<img src="LocalMCSUse.jpg" alt="Local use of the Multi Connection ThinkGear Socket" />
	<p>
		The <a href="com/github/mrstampy/esp/neurosky/MultiConnectionThinkGearSocket.html">MultiConnectionThinkGearSocket</a>
		is the core class of this library.  Listeners can register themselves with the socket implementation and will receive the generated
		events as they occur, allowing near-realtime signal acquisition from the device. 
	</p>
	<p>
		But this doesn't explain the 'multi connection' name...
	</p>
	
	<h3>Remote Connection to the Multi Connection ThinkGear Socket</h3>
	<img src="RemoteMCSUse.png" alt="Remote use of the Multi Connection ThinkGear Socket" />
	<p>
		The Multi Connection ThinkGear Socket allows connections from the
		<a href="com/github/mrstampy/esp/neurosky/subscription/ThinkGearSocketConnector.html">ThinkGearSocketConnector</a>.
		Multi connection sockets can accept many such remote connections (theoretically thousands).
		The connections can be running in the same JVM or in different Java programs, even on different computers.  Due to the introduced
		latency resulting from the remote connection the signal received cannot be considered near-realtime, however the socket connector
		is quite useful for highly buffered signals and for applications such as data recorders. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Applications using the socket connector create the connection to the multi connection socket and subscribe to receive 
		device-specific events.  Listeners register themselves with the socket connector and receive the event notifications
		as they are received by the socket connector.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Raw Signal Processing (new in version 1.3)</h3>
	<img src="RawDataProcessing.jpg" alt="Raw data processing"/>
	<p>
		In the development of the <a href="http://mrstampy.github.io/ESP-Nia/">ESP-Nia</a> implementation the base classes
		for raw signal processing were developed.  Multi connection socket implementations contain a raw data buffer which contains
		the current second's worth of data (for the OCZ Nia this translates to 3910 data points, for the ThinkGear devices this translates
		to 512 data points).
	</p>
	<p>
		Raw data event listeners can make use of <a href="com/github/mrstampy/esp/neurosky/dsp/ThinkGearSignalAggregator.html">ThinkGearSignalAggregator</a> 
		which keeps the current second's worth of snapshots in memory (number of snapshots = sample rate).  The 
		<a href="com/github/mrstampy/esp/neurosky/dsp/ThinkGearDSP.html">ThinkGearDSP</a> class
		provides the ability to apply signal processing algorithms to the current group of snapshots and notifies any 
		RawProcessedListeners upon completion of each cycle. 
		A <a href="com/github/mrstampy/esp/neurosky/dsp/ThinkGearSignalUtilities.html">utility</a> class is provided which contains
		methods which may be useful in processing the raw signal and the ESP library contains classes liberated from 
		<a href="https://github.com/ddf/Minim">Minim</a>
		and <a href="https://github.com/marytts/marytts/">MaryTTS</a> projects which can be used to process the signal.
	</p>
	<p>
		The goal of the ESP raw signal processing is to line the ducks up in a row for processing.  How the signal is 
		processed is up to the application using the library.
